# Evolent Assignment - contact mangement system

This Project is developed using Angular1.x as a front end technology.

## Folder Structure

Application related source file are in "app" folder which contains "images", "style" and "scripts". Under the "scripts" folder, to main scalabity of application, I have created sub-folder as per the module. like for registration module, there is "registration" folder which consist of template(html), controller, factory, route file related to that particular module. 

Angular1.x follows dependencies injection as architectural pattern.

I have used grunt for serving project source code as runnable javascript which takes care for building, testing as a common task using command line
